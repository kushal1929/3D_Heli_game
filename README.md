# 3D Helicopter Simulation

## Overview
This project is a 3D helicopter simulation developed using C++ and OpenGL. It features a controllable helicopter model, interactive user inputs, and basic physics for movement and rotation. The environment includes various objects and a light background for enhanced visibility.

## Features
- 3D helicopter model with animated rotor blades
- User-controlled movement
- Different camera views
- Basic game mechanics (rings and scoring system)
- Wireframe and solid rendering modes
- Light background for better contrast

## Requirements
### Software
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Development Environment**: Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or Dev-C++
- **Graphics Libraries**:
  - OpenGL
  - GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
  - GLU (OpenGL Utility Library)

### Hardware
- **Processor**: Dual-core CPU or better
- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB (Recommended 4GB+ for smooth rendering)
- **Graphics**: Integrated or dedicated GPU supporting OpenGL 2.0 or higher
- **Display**: 1024x768 resolution or higher

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-helicopter.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   - OpenGL
   - FreeGLUT (if not included in your system)
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Compile and run the program.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Change camera view
- **W**: Toggle wireframe mode
- **M**: Open menu
- **ESC**: Exit the program
- **2, 4, 6, 8**: Move the helicopter

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced physics and realism
- Additional environment elements
- Collision detection
- Sound effects and background music
